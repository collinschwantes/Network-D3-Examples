# Network-D3-Examples
A demonstration of how to build network plots using dataframes in R using the network3D package.

### Network Data
The data used in this example were obtained from the [EcoHealth Alliance FLIRT](https://flirt.eha.io/) tool. 

>FLIRT is a network analysis tool that enables users to examine flight networks to identify where infected travelers and contaminated goods are likely to travel to. FLIRT calculates the connectedness between airports using passenger, cargo, and network data. FLIRT predicts locations that are at risk of exposure to infected travelers and goods after an infectious disease outbreak has been detected.
